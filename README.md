# 2PX3 Project Source Water Monitoring

## Designing a system to collect water samples using drones ##

### Project Summary ###
Our group's idea was to implement drone photo samples and machine learning to detect algae blooms within the water. We decided to use Moose Lake, Alberta as a reference and adhered our design to its environmental constraints. My project team planned out a flight path, designed a drone that would be able to handle Alberta's climate, chose the best drone specifications, and the best algorithm to process collected image data. The team had to run simulations and decision matrices to determine the best attributes of their system and address the multiple stakeholders' concerns over the sampling system being implemented. The drone was equipped with a camera to capture images of the lake in order to measure water quality and analyze any changes over time. The team also had to consider the safety and privacy of the citizens, as well as any potential wildlife or ecological impacts of the drone. The team conducted extensive research, simulations, and experiments to ensure their system was safe and effective. The project was a success, and the team was able to provide useful data to stakeholders and the community.



### Drone Charging and Data Collection method ###
Our group utilized a portable charging/data collection station setup around the lake. The station would show a pattern that would allow the drone to recognize and land on it safely. The render below shows how the drone would automatically dock.

### Drone Flight Path and Object Avoidance ###
The drones flight path would focus on the lakeshore as algal blooms are shown to likely grow as well as makes retrieving the drone easier if it were to crash. To avoid crashes, the drone uses ultrasonic sensors to detect foliage and maneuver around it while taking photos. Example of a scenerio is shown in the render below.
